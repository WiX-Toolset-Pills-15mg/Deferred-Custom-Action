# Deferred Custom Action

## Description

This pill demonstrates how to create a deferred custom action.

The deferred custom actions are not executed in the place in which they are scheduled in the execution sequence. Instead, they are added into a list of deferred custom actions and executed at the end of the installation sequence.
